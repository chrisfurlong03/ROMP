# MOMP — Monsoon Onset Metrics Package

**MOMP** is a Python package for detecting and benchmarking **monsoon onset** in observational and forecast datasets.  
It provides tools for onset detection, ensemble forecast statistics, binned and spatial metrics, and visualization workflows commonly used in climate research.


## Key Capabilities

- Monsoon onset detection with user specified criteria
- deterministic and probabilistic benchmarking metrics
- Skill Scores (overall and binned)
- Spatial metrics (MAE, False Alarm Rate, Miss Rate)
- Reliability diagrams and spatial maps
- Customizable region definitions (rectangular boundary, shapefile, polygon outline)
- Config-driven, reproducible workflows


## Installation

MOMP is intended for **local installation from source** (GitHub or local checkout). Installation from conda-forge chanel will be available in it's future versions.  

Installing MOMP consists of **two mandatory steps**:

1. **Create and activate a Python environment**
2. **Install the MOMP source code into that environment**

These steps are **not interchangeable** and must be done in this order.


### Step 1 — Set up a Python environment

#### Option A (recommended) — Python virtual environment (pip-only)
This option is a lightweight setup which isolates project dependencies assuming the underlying operating system provides the necessary heavy lifting (doesn't duplicate system-level files).

1. `python -m venv .venv-momp`
   Creates a new virtual environment directory named `.venv-mpop` in the current folder.

2. `source .venv-momp/bin/activate`
   Activates the virtual environment so that the terminal uses the local Python instance.

3. `pip install -U pip`
   Upgrades the `pip` package manager to the latest version to ensure compatibility.

4. `pip install .`
   Installs the package with all project dependencies. Python is isolated at this point  


#### Option B — Set up Conda environment

This option is good if you work with **NetCDF, HDF5, or other system-level scientific libraries**,and if your workload is not heavy. 

1. `conda create -n momp "python>=3.10"`
Create a New Conda Environment

2. `conda activate momp`
Activate the environment:

3. `pip install poetry`
Install Poetry for dependency management

4. Install all project dependencies
```
poetry config virtualenvs.create false
poetry install
```


### Step 2 — Install the package from source

#### Clone from GitHub and install

Use this if you want the **source code** and plan to modify or inspect it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bosup/MOMP.git
cd MOMP
pip install .
```

## Verify installation
`python -c "import MOMP; print(MOMP.__file__)"`

You should see a path pointing to your **source directory**

## Configuration
Experiment configuration is controlled via:  
`params/config.in`

This file defines:
- Input and output directories
- Dataset selection
- Ensemble definitions
- Verification windows
- Region settings

Region boundaries are defined in:  
`params/region_def.py`

## Run MOMP
With user-defined `config.in`, the main benchmarking workflow is executed via command line:  

`momp-run`

Typical steps performed:
1. Load configuration
2. Read model and observation data
3. Detect monsoon onset
4. Evaluate model against reference data 
5. Generate benchmarking metrics
6. Save NetCDF outputs and figures

## Python Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.10  

Runtime dependencies include:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Xarray
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- geopandas
- seaborn

## Package Organization (high level)
- driver.py — main package workflow entry point
- app/ — high-level benchmarking workflow
- stats/ — onset detection and statistical processing
- metrics/ — error and skill score metrics calculation
- params/ — configuration files and region definitions
- lib/ — core workflow control, parsing, conventions
- io/ — input/output handling
- graphics/ — plotting and visualization
- utils/ — shared helper utilities

## Outputs
Results are written to (default or user specified dirs):

`output/` — NetCDF and serialized metric files  
`figure/` — generated plots and maps

## Development Notes
Install in editable mode for development:
`pip install -e .`  

Code is organized to separate:
- I/O
- statistics
- metrics
- visualization

## Versioning
Semantic versioning is used (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)  
Current version: 0.0.1  
APIs may evolve during development
